# DeepMind

DeepMind was founded by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in September 2010. [Hassabis](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2014/jan/28/demis-hassabis-15-facts-deepmind-technologies-founder-google) and Legg first met at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London (UCL)

Horizons Ventures and Founders Fund invested in the company, as well as entrepreneurs Scott Banister, [Peter Thiel](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-deepmind-convinced-peter-thiel-to-invest-outside-silicon-valley-2017-7), and Elon Musk.

2013, DeepMind published research on an AI system that could surpass human abilities in games such as Pong, Breakout and Enduro, while surpassing state of the art performance on Seaquest, Beamrider, and Q*bert

On January 26, 2014, Google confirmed its [acquisition](https://web.archive.org/web/20141113165033/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-27/google-buys-u-k-artificial-intelligence-company-deepmind.html) of DepMind for somewhere between 400 and 650 million. The sale to Google took place [after](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-beat-facebook-for-deepmind-creates-ethics-board) Facebook reportedly ended negotiations with DeepMind Technologies in 2013.

In 2014, DeepMind [received](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/ring/awards) the "Company of the Year" award from Cambridge Computer Laboratory. 

Also in 2014, Google established an [ethics board](https://www.forbes.com/sites/privacynotice/2014/02/03/inside-googles-mysterious-ethics-board/?sh=1b2af43b848c)

In October 2015, a computer Go program called AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the European Go champion Fan Hui, a 2 dan (out of 9 dan possible) professional, five to zero.

In 2016, DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein folding, a long-standing problem in molecular biology. 

2016, DeepMind introduced WaveNet, a text-to-speech system. It was originally too computationally intensive for use in consumer products, but in late 2017 it became ready for use in consumer applications such as Google Assistant.

016, Hassabis discussed the game StarCraft as a future challenge, since it requires strategic thinking and handling imperfect information.

2017 DeepMind released GridWorld, an open-source testbed for evaluating whether an algorithm [learns to disable](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse) its kill switch or [otherwise exhibits](https://fortune.com/2017/12/12/alphabet-deepmind-ai-safety-musk-games/) certain undesirable behaviours.

In 2017, an improved version of AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero, defeated AlphaGo 100 games to 0. AlphaGo Zero's strategies were self-taught. AlphaGo Zero was able to beat its predecessor after just three days with less processing power than AlphaGo; in comparison, the original AlphaGo needed months to learn how to play.

Later that year, AlphaZero, a modified version of AlphaGo Zero but for handling any two-player game of perfect information, gained superhuman abilities at chess and shogi. Like AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero learned solely through self-play.

In December 2018, DeepMind's AlphaFold won the 13th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins.

January 2019, DeepMind introduced AlphaStar, a program playing the real-time strategy game StarCraft II. AlphaStar used reinforcement learning based on replays from human players, and had knowledge equivalent to 200 years of playing time. It won 10 consecutive matches against two professional players, although it had the unfair advantage of being able to see the entire field, unlike a human player who has to move the camera manually.

October 2019, AlphaStar reached Grandmaster level on the StarCraft II ladder on all three StarCraft races, becoming the first AI to reach the top league of a widely popular esport without any game restrictions.

In December 2019, co-founder Suleyman announced he would be leaving DeepMind to join Google, working in a policy role.

In 2020, in the 14th CASP, AlphaFold's predictions achieved an accuracy score regarded as comparable with lab techniques. Dr Andriy Kryshtafovych, one of the panel of scientific adjudicators, described the achievement as "truly remarkable", and said the problem of predicting how proteins fold had been "largely solved"

In July 2021, the open-source RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2 were released to allow scientists to run their own versions of the tools. A week later DeepMind announced that AlphaFold had completed its prediction of nearly all human proteins as well as the entire proteomes of 20 other widely studied organisms. The structures were released on the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.

In 2022, DeepMind unveiled AlphaCode, an AI-powered coding engine that creates computer programs at a rate comparable to that of an average programmer, with the company testing the system against coding challenges created by Codeforces utilized in human competitive programming competitions. AlphaCode earned a rank equivalent to 54% of the median score on Codeforces after being trained on GitHub data and Codeforce problems and solutions.

In July 2022, it was announced that the predictions of over 200 million proteins, representing virtually all known proteins, would be released on the AlphaFold database.

In October 2022, DeepMind unveiled a new version of AlphaZero, called AlphaTensor, in a paper published in Nature. The version discovered a faster way to perform matrix multiplication – one of the most fundamental tasks in computing – using reinforcement learning. For example, AlphaTensor figured out how to multiply two mod-2 4x4 matrices in only 47 multiplications, unexpectedly beating the 1969 Strassen algorithm record of 49 multiplications

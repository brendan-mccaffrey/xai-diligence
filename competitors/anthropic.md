# Anthropic

Anthropic PBC is an American artificial intelligence (AI) startup and public-benefit corporation, founded by former members of OpenAI.

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former senior members of OpenAI, principally siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei, the latter of whom served as OpenAI's Vice President of Research.
 
The Amodei siblings were among others who left OpenAI due to directional differences, specifically regarding OpenAI's ventures with Microsoft in 2019.

By late 2022, Anthropic had raised US$700 million in funding, out of which US$500 million came from Alameda Research. Google's cloud division followed with an investment of US$300 million for a 10% stake, in a deal requiring Anthropic to buy computing resources from Google Cloud.

In May 2023, Anthropic raised US$450 million in a round led by Spark Capital.

As of July 2023, Anthropic had raised US$1.5 billion in funding.
